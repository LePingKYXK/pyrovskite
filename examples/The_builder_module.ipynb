    "1) Layer penetration (i.e. how far the Ap spacing cation penetrates into the BX6 octahedra as a fraction of the BX-bond length) can be specified by the kwarg ```penet= 0 < val < 1``` for all 2d perovskites. 0.3 is the sensible default.\n",
    "2) Interlayer penetration (i.e. how far the spacers interlock with one another in the case of 2D RP perovskites) can be specified by the kwarg ```interlayer_penet = 0 < val < 1```. 0.4 is the sensible default.\n",
    "3) Small rotations to the spacing cations can be passed with the Ap_Rx,y,z functions. I.e. to rotate your spacer 20deg along the y axis before interfacing with the perovskite, specifiy the kwarg ```Ap_Rx = 20```.\n",
    "4) A rudimentary workflow for adding your own spacing cations can be done by using the ```builder.determine_molecule_orientation``` and/or ```builder.orient_along_z``` functions. If you'd like to add a spacer and contribute to the repository shipped with the code, please see the conventions detailed in the code.\n",
    "5) All 2D perovksite coordinates can be wrapped (universally False as a default, so as not to break covalently bonded A-site/Ap-site cations upon visualization) by specifying the kwarg ```wrap=True```.\n",
    "6) Setting BX-bond lengths too small will result in overlapping atoms, see the tools directory for a means by which to check/modify spacer orientation to minimize this as an issue.\n"
